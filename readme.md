## Recommendation

1. Involvement of the general student population in worthy projects
such that it is beneficial to the students. being a small faculty,
the well being of the collective depends on the well being of the
individual.

2. Set out and accomplish at least 5 major goals within an academic
year. Students would like to see action and result, not bureaucracy
nor administrative delays. With a pending event, project, the focus
should be on that specific event, rather than split it up to those
responsible for the activity.

3. Better forms of communication, be it electronic, visual, or open air
presentation. Students would like to know what's going on, but
sometimes don't have the time. Go in person to a classroom (with
permission from prof of course). Publish a newsletter or put up
posters advertising an event well in advance rather than last
minute.
